I attend a university, which is small, located in rural Seoul where is relatively high altitude and surrounded with mountains. Dew to its location, my university is quite eco-friendly, with many cats and birds, even wild boars ambush the school occasionally. 
What I majored in is belonged to Business Administration School, which is located in the Concert Hall, one of the main building of University right next to central soccer field and running track. It is 5 storied building with wide rectangular shape, and recently remodeled with up-to-date technology for lecture. So almost every lecture room can provide nice presentation and electronic attendance.   
There is a gymnasium building beside the Business School with octagon shape, with large basketball field and auditorium. So it oftenly used for school event, like Entrance ceremony for freshmen, and because of its distinctive shape, it often appear to outer media , like youtube for contents stage. Thank you for listening.

Q. 가장 최근에 휴일을 보낸 방법 
[지난 주말에 있었던 일]
I went to the Gapyung and Chun-Cheon last weekend with my girlfriend. //어디갔다
Dew to the 'pandemic' virus, recently people tend to travel in rural areas, riding their own car rather than public transportation. //왜?(요즘 ~한 때문에)

The weather was fantastic, clear sky with little breeze, warm temperature. It was hard to endure the picnic. So I'd picked up my girlfriend, then headed to the cafe, located in somewhere deserted area in Gapyung, where I had my eyes on. // 카페를 감 

There were some enjoyable things in the cafe, and one of them was if you write a log about cafe with photo and tag on your sns, instagram or something, then they lend us bicycles.  
// 특별한 경험 
It was best place to ride bicycles with well paved roads along the mountains and river for riding, and small tunnels on the road create distinctive atmosphere which providing great photo zones. //가서 한일 

It was nice, healing picnic, and mostly I was glad to have some new contents and experience with my girlfriend.
