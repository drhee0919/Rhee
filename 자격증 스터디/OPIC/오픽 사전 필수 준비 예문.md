- 설정된 취미를 수영으로 가정해보자 
Q. 수영을 처음 어떻게 배웠는지, 언제 수영을 배웠고 세월이 흐르면서 당신의 실력은 좋아졌는지.
Actually, the period of my swimming experience is short. 
I learned it after becoming an adult. I remember that I first learned swimming when I was in college 2nd grade. I was always desired to learn swimming, because when I was a kid, I used to be in dangerous situation during water play, I loved water play and I loved everywhere with water, but I was stoned in the water. Anyway, I attended a class which was held in sports center near my home, and it was adult class consisted with over 5 memebers, but I never met anyone of them during my class time. It was nearly personal tutoring course, which was profit to me anyway. 
The teacher who taught me was young man near my ages, and very passionate. 
The learning progress was quite faster than I thought. Firstly, I learned about how to float, of course. And then about breast stroke, crawl stroke, and back stroke, sort of. Unfortunately I couldn't learn about butterfly stroke, because lecture was only one month course. I had to back in semester so it was my first and last swimming lecture. 
However, swimming became one of my life routine. I occasionally attend to sport center or youth center for free swimming. I feels like my stamina is growing gradually even I getting ages and weights. I recommend swimming strongly who wants healthy life.

4) 답변 마무리(반문)

Recently, movies can be enjoyed nearly everyone so easily. Especially thanks to the streaming platforms, like netflix, watcha, even youtube, we can enjoy it even with the cell phone. I'm not such a movie buff, but occasionally enjoy it in everytime and where ever I am. I used to enjoy every genre, except the horror films. Well, the well made thriller is one of my favorite types, but nowadays I think so much horror films are depending on boring production, like jumpscares, so much explicit, gory productions that make me sick. 
I also enjoy to go to movie theatre, and also like large scale, majestic production movies that can only fulfilled in theatre. I can remember clearly about the scene that rohan cavalary's warcry of death in lord of the rings, even I watched it when I was in elementary school. How about you? Do you have any movie or scene that can remember through whole life?
